# CS320 Mobile Application Services

## Overview
This CS320 project demonstrates the development of three core services for a demo mobile application: Contact, Appointment, and Task. The project includes **real Java code** and **JUnit unit tests**, showcasing software development and QA/testing skills.

## Purpose
- Develop functional Java services following software requirements  
- Implement input validation and exception handling  
- Demonstrate QA and testing skills through real code  
- Maintain a professional, portfolio-ready GitHub repository  

## Project Contents
- **Java Source Code** – ContactService, AppointmentService, TaskService  
- **Unit Tests** – JUnit test classes for each service  
- **Documentation** – README and supporting files  

## Key Highlights
- **Contact Service:** Add, update, and delete contacts with validation on IDs, names, phone numbers, and addresses  
- **Appointment Service:** Schedule appointments with validation to prevent past dates  
- **Task Service:** Manage tasks efficiently, ensuring accurate input and functionality  
- **Unit Testing:** JUnit tests for each service demonstrating expected behavior and edge cases  
- **Code Included:** All project code is available and organized for easy review  

## Skills Demonstrated
